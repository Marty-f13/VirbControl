# VirbControl

This project has a phone app and Adroid Wear app for controlling the Garmin Virb action camera.  See API here:
https://developer.garmin.com/virb/overview/

Developed and tested with Garmin Virb Ultra 30 camera, Moto-X phone (3rd gen), and Moto 360 Sport watch.

The goal for these apps is just very basic camera controls to use an Android Wear device to access the Garmin API over WiFi to control snapping a photo, and starting and stopping video recording.  Garmin has not supported Android Wear and their Virb app does not support hotspotting the phone to create a WiFi network for the camera while also staying connected to the internet over cellular.  Their app will not find the phone on the local network.  It stops and asks you to connect direct to camera.  This app was created to address these gaps.
